				Using binary
		    </h2>
				Binary is used to represent data and instructions in a program.
		    <p>
		    <div class="sub">
			But what's so special about binary?
		    </div>
				Computer processors contain billions of transistors (like
		    a switch) that only have two states: on and off (like a
		    switch again).
		    <br>
		    Because there are only 2 states, binary is used to represent
		    these states and thus determine what the computer should do.
		    <p>
		    <div class="sub">
				The binary system
		    </div>
		    The two states in binary are represented by 1 (on) and 0 (off).
		    These are called 'binary digits' or 'bits'. All instructions and
		    data including graphics and sound are represented as millions of
		    bits.
		    <p>
		    <div class="sub">
            	Why are binary numbers so long?
            </div>
		    Because binary only has two numbers, you need multiple digits to
		    symbolise the same value. (For example, 42, while only needing 2
		    digits in 'standard' numbering, requires 6 digits in binary
		    numbering [101010]) This results in a generally longer number, when
            compared to other forms of numbering.
		    <p>
		    <h2 style="color: #00a8ff">
				Converting to binary
		    </h2>
            You can convert 'standard' (also called 'decimal' or 'denary')
            numbers with values between 0 and 255 into 8-bit binary numbers
            (binary numbers with 8 digits). Denary numbers above 255 need more
            digits. I have made a video on YouTube for converting denar
            numbers to binary and vice versa. You can see it here:

				Logical shifts
		    </h2>
            <div class="sub">
            	What are they?
            </div>
            Logical shifts are used when you want to multiply or divide binary
            numbers by a number which is a power of 2. (Including: 2, 4, 8, 16,
            32, 64, etc) Logical shifts aren't just restricted to binary
            though, it is also used in decimal, except what you do is multiply
            or divide by a number which is a power of 10. (Including: 10, 100,
            1000, etc.)
