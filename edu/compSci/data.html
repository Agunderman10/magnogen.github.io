            	Using binary
            </h2>
			Binary is used to represent data and instructions in a program.
            <p>
            <div class="sub">
            	But what's so special about binary?
            </div>
			Well, computer processors contain billions of transistors (like
            a switch) that only have two states: on and off (like a
            switch again).
            <br>
            Because there are only 2 states, binary is used to represent
            these states and thus determine what the computer should do.
            <p>
            <div class="sub">
            	The binary system
            </div>
            The two states in binary are represented by 1 (on) and 0 (off).
            These are called 'binary digits' or 'bits'. All instructions and
            data including graphics and sound are represented as millions of
            bits.
