				What programming languages did you use to make this website?<br>
				Also, which one do you think is easier to code in?
				</div>
				<blockquote>
				I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript - mainly JavaScript for the 'Flappy square' game)<br>
				Hmmm... I think that HTML has lots of quick and easy-to-use tags but<br>
				I'm gonna have to go with CSS to be the easiest language to code in.

				What is your favourite programming language in general?
				</div>
				<blockquote>
				When I saw this question, I thought to myself "Oh no! They asked the<br>
				unanswerable 'favourite' question! What am I going to do now?".<br>
				So, in other words, all of the ones I know - including:
				Scratch, Python, CSS, HTML, Batch files, as well as many others...<br>
				because I think that all programming languages are good and special in their own way.<br>
				<i>Looking back at what I just wrote, I feel so cringy.</i>

				I have only said my username because I am protective about sharing<br>
				personal details on the internet. And also I don't want identity-frauders<br>
